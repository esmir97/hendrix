                        <p>Axis: Bold As Love's scheduled release date was almost delayed when Hendrix lost the master tape of the LP, leaving it in the back seat of a London taxi. With the deadline looming, Hendrix, Chas Chandler, and engineer Eddie Kramer remixed most of side one in a single overnight session.</p>
